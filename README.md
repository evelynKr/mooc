## MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses)

### MOOC (Massive Open Online Course):

MOOCs are online courses with video content. <br /> 
They enable large numbers of participants to learn from top universities around the world. <br />
This is what you need to know about MOOCs.

### What´s unique about MOOCs?

MOOCs were created from the idea of covering an entire university course online and thereby making it accessible to everyone in the world.
The intent was to "democratize" educational content from elite universities.
High-quality education should not be available to just a small group of university students in developed countries, but to everyone who is willing to learn – from Alabama to Zanzibar. 

### Which topics are covered by MOOCs? 

MOOCs cover many topics that are also taught at the university level. In general, most university subjects can be taught in a MOOC format. And practical skills for professional development are becoming important as well.
The number of high-quality MOOCs is especially high in some subject areas.

For example:
computer science / programming
business / management / economics.
(Find all other topics here)

Many MOOCs are presented in English and may include subtitles in English (and other languages) or transcripts. This way, international students can learn the English terminology in addition to the actual course content.


### Can you receive certificates for MOOCs?

Yes, most MOOCs offer optional certificates (for a fee). You will have to meet the course requirements, for example, reach a minimum score on the online tests.
The certificate then shows the name of the MOOC provider (e.g., edX) and the educational institution that created the course content (e.g., Harvard University).
MOOC certificates can be helpful in job applications as well. Due to the increasing prominence of MOOCs, more and more employers know about the value of these certificates. ("Are the Certificates Worth It?")
You can also integrate MOOC certificates into your online resume, for instance with LinkedIn.
